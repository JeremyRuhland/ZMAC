Currently working on Promiscuous Mode demo

1. Copied app_config from the app into the library.
2. Hard-coded #defines in pal.h which should be passed it at command-line (actually put in DEFINES now).  Actually, I am needing to stash this in all over the place.  in fileprep_awk 
3. Argh!  Code uses c99 standards, but Arduino does not and cannot set it. workaround by gawk'ing fors areund
4. Redistrubiting main.c, contrary to license, and reforumlating it into a PDE.  This could be done by gawk.
5. Created empty AVR2025.h
6. pal.h redefines LOW & HIGH!! changed to pin_LOW pin_HIGH in fileprep.awk
7. pal.h and tal.h needs an extra } at end but only if C++, not sure why.

Things to try to do now

- try to turn on as many DEFINES as possible, reduce the number of possibilities down.

ENABLE_TFA:
OK

ENABLE_TSTAMP:
OK

Requires mac_user_build_config.h

This probably becomes another board config.

TODO
* User stories
* Board configs: RFD, FFD, API
	* API: MAC_USER_BUILD_CONFIG plus FFD
	* FFD: FFD
	* RFD: Nothing additional
